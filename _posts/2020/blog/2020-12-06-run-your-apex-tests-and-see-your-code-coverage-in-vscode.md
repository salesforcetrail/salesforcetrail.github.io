## Intro

If you are using VSCode for developing Apex and LWC, you can use it to run your tests and check your classes code coverage easily.

## Running your tests

In VSCode at the left side pane, you can go to the Test view, click there and run the tests, with the play button at the top of the test list:

## Highlight your code coverage
Once you have your tests run, you can highlight your code coverage clicking on the icon of three horizontal bars in the status bar:
